# Web Project: Plant Store Landing Page
This is a responsive, modern landing page for an e-commerce plant store, built using HTML5 and CSS3.

# Project Goal and Source
This project was developed by following a YouTube tutorial (Tuto Graven - Boutique de plantes) to practice fundamental web development skills, including CSS layout and responsive design. The goal was to build a clean, engaging interface based on a provided mock-up.

# Key Technical Features
The project demonstrates proficiency in several front-end techniques:

Semantic HTML5: The structure uses standard elements (<section>, <header>, <footer>) for clarity and accessibility.

Modern CSS3 Layout: The design heavily utilizes Flexbox (for the header and footer) and CSS Grid (for the main product gallery) to manage complex page layouts efficiently.

Responsive Design: Media queries are implemented in PROJET WEB CSS.css to ensure the layout adapts seamlessly across different devices, particularly for mobile and tablet views.

CSS Animations: Includes subtle visual effects like the scroll-text animation and transitions on navigation links for a polished user experience.

JavaScript Interactivity: A minimal amount of vanilla JavaScript is used to handle the mobile navigation menu by toggling the active class on the burger icon and navigation links.
