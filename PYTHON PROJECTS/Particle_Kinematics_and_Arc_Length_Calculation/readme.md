## Particle Kinematics and Arc Length

This Python project uses Vector Calculus to analyze the motion of a particle defined by the trajectory vector function:
r(t) = (cos(-t), sin(2t))

The velocity vector is the derivative of the trajectory:
v(t) = r'(t) = (sin(t), 2cos(2t))

### Part A: Detailed Analysis (t=2 to t=5)

* **Trajectory Plot:** Visualizes the specific segment of the particle's path between t=2 and t=5.
* **Velocity Field:** Plots the velocity vectors v(t) at discrete points along the trajectory segment. This shows the direction and magnitude (speed) of the particle's motion at various times.

* **Arc Length (Distance Traveled):** Calculates the exact distance the particle travels along the curve using numerical integration of the speed (the norm of the velocity vector).
  Distance L = integral from t=2 to t=5 of ||v(t)|| dt = integral from t=2 to t=5 of sqrt((sin(t))^2 + (2cos(2t))^2) dt

### Part B: Complete Trajectory Visualization

* **Complete Plot:** Visualizes the full path of the particle from its starting time (t=0) up to t=5.8, showing the complex curve generated by the parametric function.
* **Key Concept:** The path is a Lissajous curve or related figure, demonstrating motion that is oscillatory in both the x and y directions.
